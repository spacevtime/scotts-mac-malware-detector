# scotts-mac-malware-detector
Shell script for Mac OSX that quarantines unwanted files which may be associated with malware, viruses, trojans, etc.

Purpose
=======
This script searches a MacOSX drive volume for "undesired" files commonly associated with, or presumed to be malware, viruses, trojans, etc. and quarantines any found files.  Some of the files quarantined by this script might not be true malware in the strictest sense.


Warning/Disclaimer
==================
Although written with care and documented, this shell script was written quickly and tested minimally.  Use at your own risk.  If you suspect your computer is infected, you can run this script to remove files which have caused problems for me and people I know.  This may or may not help you in your situation.


Files Qarantined
================
 * ChatZum
 * Codec-M
 * Conduit
 * CTLoader
 * Genio
 * InstallMac
 * MacKeeper dufh
 * SaveKeep
 * Spigot Search Protect
 * SIMBL
 * Ventir keylogger
 * VidX
 * Vuze


Systems Tested
==============
This script has been run successfully on:
 * Mac OSX 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)
 * Mac OSX 10.10.1 (Yosemite)


How to use
==========
Note that the default behavior is to just scan the current startup volume.  You must explicitly select the option to quarantine.

 * Download and unzip the master zip file from GitHub
 * Open Terminal (in Applications->Utilities folder)
 * type `sudo su` and enter your administrator's password
 * type `sh ` (with a space at the end) and then drag the script file you downloaded into the terminal window so the entire line looks something like `sh Macintosh\ HD/Users/MyLogin/Downloads/scotts-mac-malware-detector-master/scotts_malware_detector.sh`
 * press the `return` key

To explicitly select the quarantining behavior, simply add ` -q` at the end of the command, before pressing return. The the command then becomes `sh [path to file]/scotts_malware_detector.sh -q`


Why
===
Some family members recently downloaded some sketchy video playback software and it caused all sorts of havok on their systems.  They called me to fix it, and so I wrote this script so I wouldn't have to bark terminal commands to them over the phone from 3000 miles away.
